            <h3>Chatbot</h3>
            <p>I developed an interactive chatbot capable of responding to user queries efficiently. Built using Python, the chatbot leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enhance user interaction and provide accurate responses. It is designed to be adaptable for various applications, such as customer support and personal assistance. The project incorporates web-based deployment using Flask/Django, making it easily accessible. With real-time response capabilities and potential for machine learning-based improvements, this chatbot showcases my skills in software development, AI integration, and user-centric application design.</p>

            <p>I developed an e-commerce website inspired by Meesho, designed to provide a seamless online shopping experience. This platform allows users to browse, add products to their cart, and complete secure transactions. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend frameworks like Django/Flask, the website ensures a user-friendly interface with smooth navigation. Key features include product categorization, a responsive design, and an efficient order management system.
